Programmming 1 Project

To be honest, I have been having difficulties with this project, I am unable to figure out some errors, It is mainly related to assignment, course and student connection.
I tried asking a friend and searching up online the errors I got, but I couldn't figure it out. BUT, I did what I knew and could.

There are classes:
Address: Contains information for an Address
Assignment: Contains information for an Assignment
Course: Contains information for a Course
